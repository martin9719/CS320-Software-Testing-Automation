### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Insuring that code is both functional and secure is not an easy undertaking. So far, the only testing I've done of code has been for this course, and it was a little excessive in certain situations to make sure everything worked. This course has opened my eyes to the depths of complexity involved. By being true to the requirements and creating thorough tests that yield a high coverage percentage when the code is tested, I can guarantee that it is both safe and functional. My software for this course passed all of the necessary tests to guarantee at least a 90% coverage rate. Making sure the code works basically required sticking to the requirements, and making sure it was secure required developing thorough tests based on the requirements.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
